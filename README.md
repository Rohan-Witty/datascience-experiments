This repo is used for a few of classical ML and data exploration projects.

## X-Ray Image Filters

Here, various image processing techniques have been used on a dataset of X-Ray images to identify the presence of tubes and catheters. 

The process was exploratory in nature and both the positive and negative results are documented in the notebook.

## Customer Segmentation

Here, statistical techniques like PCA and K-Means are used on the data of credit card customers and the clusters are investigated by profiling.

## Loans

Exploratory Data Analysis is used to draw various insights from the loan data provided by US Small Business Administration on their website here - [PPP FOIA - Dataset - U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) | Open Data](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia)
